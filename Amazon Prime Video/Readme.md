# Study Case (Amazon Prime Video)

Case study documentation on Amazon Prime Video data analysis. Data retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows). I did this case study while attending the Mini Course at RevoU.

## Ask
In the first step, I determine what things can be analyzed and what I want to know.

1. How many shows by type of show?
2. How was the trend of the year released from 2010?
3. Which rating gets the most show?
4. Which category gets the most show?

## Prepare
To answer the question, I saw and analyzed data attribute from tables, what data attribute can be taken from the tables to answer the question.

## Process
Before analyzing the data, I first check and clean the data, such as checking for missing values or incorrect values that might cause errors.

## Analyze
After determining what data is needed, I implement it using spreadsheet to get the data needed. After that I created a visualization using Looker Data Studio based on the data that had been retrieved
