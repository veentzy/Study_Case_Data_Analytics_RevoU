# Study Case (The Look E-Commerce)

Documentation of a case study on bigquery data called TheLook E-Commerce. I did this case study while attending the Mini Course at RevoU. In the case study, there are 4 tables that can be analyzed.

1. Users table : records all personal detail of customers.
2. Orders table : records all the orders placed by the customer.
3. Order_items table : records the list of the items purchased in every order ID.
4. Products table : records the details of the products sold on The Look, including the price, brand, and product categories.

## Ask
In the first step, I determine what things can be analyzed to help solve problems that exist in the company.

1. How is the comparison of the number of users of The Look based on gender and age group
2. Which countries have ordered using The Look E-commerce?
3. What category is the most top selling?
4. What category gets the most revenue?
5. How monthly sales trend at The Look E-Commerce?
6. how is the revenue trend for each category every month at The Look E-Commerce?

## Prepare
To answer the question, I saw and analyzed data attribute from tables, what data attribute can be taken from the tables to answer the question.

## Process
Before analyzing the data, I first check and clean the data, such as checking for missing values or incorrect values that might cause errors.

## Analyze
After determining what data is needed, I implement it using SQL to get the data needed. After that I created a visualization using Looker Data Studio based on the data that had been retrieved
