# Study Case (Game Sales)

Case study documentation on Netflix data analysis. Data retrieved from [Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/id/document/sekolah-tinggi-manajemen-informatika-dan-komputer-mikroskil/accounting/games-sales-052745/42871488). I did this case study while attending the Mini Course at RevoU.

## Ask
In the first step, I determine what things can be analyzed and what I want to know.

1. How many shows by type of show?
2. How many shows are broadcast in each country?
3. Which category gets the most show?

## Prepare
To answer the question, I saw and analyzed data attribute from tables, what data attribute can be taken from the tables to answer the question.

## Process
Before analyzing the data, I first check and clean the data, such as checking for missing values or incorrect values that might cause errors.

## Analyze
After determining what data is needed, I implement it using spreadsheet to get the data needed. After that I created a visualization using Google Colaboratory based on the data that had been retrieved
